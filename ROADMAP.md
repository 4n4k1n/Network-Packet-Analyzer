# Network Packet Analyzer - Practical Roadmap

A step-by-step guide for building a working network packet analyzer in Go, starting from the current basic setup.

## Current State
- Basic Go project with "Hello World" main.go
- Empty Makefile and inc/ directory
- No dependencies or modules configured

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure (Days 1-2)

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Initialize Go module**: `go mod init network-packet-analyzer`
2. **Create proper directory structure**:
   ```
   src/
   ├── main.go           # Entry point
   ├── capture/          # Packet capture logic
   ├── parser/           # Protocol parsing
   ├── utils/            # Helper functions
   └── types/            # Data structures
   ```
3. **Setup Makefile** with basic build/clean targets
4. **Add core dependencies**: `gopacket`, `pcap`

### Deliverables
- Working Go module with proper structure
- Functional Makefile
- Dependencies installed and importable

## Phase 2: Basic Packet Capture (Days 3-5)

### Core Functionality
1. **Network interface discovery** - List available interfaces
2. **Basic packet capture** using gopacket/pcap
3. **Simple packet counting** and basic statistics
4. **Clean shutdown** with signal handling

### Implementation Focus
- Use `github.com/google/gopacket/pcap` for capture
- Handle permissions (requires root/sudo)
- Basic error handling and logging
- Simple CLI interface

### Deliverables
- Program can capture packets from network interface
- Display packet count and basic stats
- Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C

## Phase 3: Basic Protocol Parsing (Days 6-10)

### Layer by Layer
1. **Ethernet frame parsing** - MAC addresses, frame type
2. **IP header parsing** - Source/dest IPs, protocol type
3. **TCP/UDP basic parsing** - Ports, flags, payload size
4. **Display formatted output** - Human-readable packet info

### Data Structures
- Define packet structure types
- Create protocol statistics counters
- Simple connection tracking (IP:port pairs)

### Deliverables
- Parse and display Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP headers
- Show source/destination addresses and ports
- Basic protocol distribution statistics

## Phase 4: Enhanced Analysis (Days 11-15)

### Features to Add
1. **Protocol filtering** - Only show specific protocols
2. **IP/port filtering** - Focus on specific addresses
3. **Connection tracking** - Track TCP connections
4. **Save to file** - Basic PCAP file writing
5. **Configuration file** - YAML/JSON config

### Improvements
- Better CLI argument parsing
- Configurable output formats
- Basic performance metrics
- Memory usage optimization

### Deliverables
- Filtering capabilities
- Connection state tracking
- File output support
- Configuration management

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Days 16-25)

### Choose Your Focus Area
Pick 1-2 areas based on your interests:

**Option A: Security Analysis**
- Port scan detection
- Suspicious traffic patterns
- Basic intrusion detection rules

**Option B: Performance Monitoring**
- Bandwidth calculation per connection
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Network topology mapping

**Option C: Application Layer**
- HTTP request/response parsing
- DNS query analysis
- Common protocol detection

### Deliverables
- One fully implemented advanced feature set
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation

## Required Dependencies

### Essential Libraries
```go
github.com/google/gopacket v1.1.19
github.com/google/gopacket/pcap v1.1.19
gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.4.0  // For config files
```

### System Requirements
- Linux/macOS (Windows has limitations)
- libpcap-dev installed
- Root privileges for packet capture
- Go 1.19+

## Realistic Deliverables Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- Working packet capture
- Basic protocol parsing
- Simple CLI interface

### Week 2: Core Features
- Protocol filtering
- Connection tracking
- File I/O support

### Week 3-4: Polish & Extension
- Choose one advanced feature
- Testing and documentation
- Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product
- Capture packets from network interface
- Parse Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP headers
- Display human-readable output
- Basic filtering capabilities
- Save captured data

### Stretch Goals (if time permits)
- One advanced analysis feature
- Web interface for real-time monitoring
- Performance benchmarking
- Cross-platform support

## Getting Started Commands

```bash
# Initialize the project
cd Network-Packet-Analyzer
go mod init network-packet-analyzer

# Install required system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

# Add Go dependencies
go get github.com/google/gopacket
go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap

# Test packet capture (requires root)
sudo go run src/main.go
```

This roadmap is designed to build a functional packet analyzer progressively, with each phase producing working software. Focus on completing each phase fully before moving to the next.
