# Network Packet Analyzer - Beginner's Learning Roadmap

A gentle introduction to network programming and packet analysis in Go, designed for complete beginners.

## What You'll Learn
- **Networking Basics**: How computers communicate over networks
- **Go Programming**: Practical Go development with real-world libraries
- **System Programming**: Working with network interfaces and raw data
- **Data Analysis**: Processing and understanding network traffic

## Current State
- Basic Go "Hello World" program
- Need to learn: Go modules, networking concepts, packet analysis

## Phase 1: Foundation & Learning (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Understanding Networks
**Learning Goals:**
- What is a network packet?
- How do computers send data over the internet?
- What are IP addresses and ports?

**Hands-on Tasks:**
1. **Read about networking basics** (30 minutes)
2. **Set up Go module**: `go mod init network-packet-analyzer`
3. **Simple networking experiment**: Use `ping` and `netstat` commands
4. **First Go network program**: Connect to a website using `net/http`

**What you'll build:**
```go
// A simple program that makes HTTP requests and shows the response
```

### Day 3-4: Your First Packet Sniffer
**Learning Goals:**
- How to capture network traffic
- Understanding packet structure basics
- Working with Go libraries

**Tasks:**
1. **Install system dependencies**: `sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`
2. **Add Go library**: `go get github.com/google/gopacket`
3. **Build simple packet counter**: Count packets going through your network interface
4. **Learn about permissions**: Why you need `sudo` for packet capture

**What you'll build:**
```
Network Interface: eth0
Packets captured: 1,247
Time running: 30 seconds
```

### Day 5-7: Understanding What You Capture
**Learning Goals:**
- What's inside a network packet?
- IP addresses, ports, and protocols
- Reading packet headers

**Tasks:**
1. **Extract basic info from packets**: Source IP, destination IP
2. **Count different protocols**: HTTP, DNS, etc.
3. **Display results nicely**: Format output in tables
4. **Add basic filtering**: Only show web traffic (port 80/443)

**What you'll build:**
```
Source IP        Dest IP          Protocol  Port
192.168.1.100    8.8.8.8         UDP       53    (DNS)
192.168.1.100    172.217.16.142  TCP       443   (HTTPS)
```

## Phase 2: Building Real Features (Week 2)

### Day 8-10: Making It User-Friendly
**Learning Goals:**
- Command-line argument parsing
- Configuration files
- Better error handling

**Tasks:**
1. **Add command-line options**: `-interface eth0`, `-count 100`
2. **Create config file**: YAML file for default settings
3. **Improve error messages**: Help users fix common problems
4. **Add help documentation**: `--help` flag

**What you'll build:**
```bash
./analyzer --interface wlan0 --protocol tcp --port 443
```

### Day 11-14: Data Analysis Features
**Learning Goals:**
- Storing and organizing data
- Basic statistics and reporting
- File input/output

**Tasks:**
1. **Save captured data**: Write to files for later analysis
2. **Generate traffic reports**: Most active IPs, protocols used
3. **Connection tracking**: See which websites you visit most
4. **Time-based analysis**: Traffic patterns over time

**What you'll build:**
```
Traffic Report (Last 5 minutes):
Top Websites: google.com (45%), github.com (23%), stackoverflow.com (18%)
Protocols: HTTPS (67%), DNS (28%), HTTP (5%)
Data transferred: 2.3 MB
```

## Phase 3: Choose Your Adventure (Week 3-4)

### Option A: Web Dashboard (Good for Visual Learners)
**What you'll learn:** Web development, real-time data display

**Build:**
- Simple web page showing live network stats
- Graphs and charts of network activity
- Start/stop packet capture from browser

### Option B: Security Focus (Good for Security Interest)
**What you'll learn:** Network security basics, pattern detection

**Build:**
- Detect unusual activity (too many connections)
- Alert on suspicious traffic patterns
- Basic intrusion detection features

### Option C: Performance Analysis (Good for System Optimization)
**What you'll learn:** Performance measurement, optimization

**Build:**
- Measure network speed and latency
- Identify network bottlenecks
- Bandwidth usage per application

## Required Setup

### System Requirements
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install libpcap

# You'll also need Go 1.19+ installed
```

### Project Structure (You'll build this gradually)
```
network-packet-analyzer/
├── main.go              # Your main program
├── go.mod               # Go dependencies
├── config.yaml          # Configuration file
├── capture/             # Packet capture code
│   └── sniffer.go
├── analysis/            # Data analysis code
│   └── stats.go
└── utils/               # Helper functions
    └── display.go
```

## Learning Resources

### Before You Start
1. **"Networks for Dummies" basics** - YouTube videos on networking
2. **Go language tour** - tour.golang.org (1-2 hours)
3. **Command line basics** - If you're not comfortable with terminal

### During Development
1. **Go documentation** - pkg.go.dev
2. **Wireshark tutorials** - See what professional packet analysis looks like
3. **RFC documents** - Official protocol specifications (when you get curious)

## Success Milestones

### Week 1 Goal
- Capture packets from your network interface
- Display basic packet information
- Understand what you're looking at

### Week 2 Goal
- Build a useful tool with filtering and configuration
- Generate meaningful reports about your network traffic
- Comfortable with Go programming

### Week 3-4 Goal
- Complete one advanced feature (dashboard/security/performance)
- Understand networking concepts well enough to explain to others
- Have a portfolio project to show

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Beginner Issues
1. **"Permission denied"** → Need to run with `sudo`
2. **"No such package"** → Need to install libpcap-dev
3. **"No packets captured"** → Wrong network interface
4. **"Program crashes"** → Add error handling (we'll teach you)

### Getting Help
- Read error messages carefully
- Google the specific error
- Check if other programs can capture packets (`tcpdump -i eth0`)
- Start with simple examples and build up

This roadmap assumes you're starting from scratch and focuses on learning through building. Each phase gives you working software while teaching important concepts.

## Your First Steps (Start Here!)

### Day 1 Tasks
```bash
# 1. Initialize your Go project
cd Network-Packet-Analyzer
go mod init network-packet-analyzer

# 2. Test your Go installation
go version

# 3. Make a simple HTTP request program
# (Replace your current main.go with networking code)

# 4. Learn basic terminal commands
ping google.com
netstat -i  # Show network interfaces
```

### When You're Ready for Packet Capture
```bash
# Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

# Add the packet capture library
go get github.com/google/gopacket
go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap

# Test with a tiny packet counter
sudo go run main.go
```

Remember: This is a learning journey, not a race. Each small step builds your understanding!
